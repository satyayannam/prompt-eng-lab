      "\n",
      "A Decision Tree is a tree-like model that splits data into subsets based on feature values. It starts with a root node representing the entire dataset, and then recursively partitions the data into smaller subsets until each node represents an individual data point or a single class label.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How does it work?**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The algorithm selects the most informative feature to split the data at each node.\n",
      "2. It creates child nodes based on the selected feature values, splitting the data further.\n",
      "3. This process continues recursively until all data points are assigned to a leaf node representing the predicted class label.\n",
      "4. Each internal node represents an attribute or feature used for splitting.\n",
